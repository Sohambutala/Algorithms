Array Notes (Python)

[Array Concatenation](./Concatenation%20of%20Array/Solution.py) 

#### Somehow nums.extend(nums) doesn't seem to work 

[Number of Good Pairs](./Number%20of%20Good%20Pairs/Solution.py)

#### Trick here is to use add the count each time we find a similar item since we are calculating the number of pairs, instead of storing in a map and then computing all the combinations.

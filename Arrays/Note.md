Array Notes (Python)

[Array Concatenation](./Concatenation%20of%20Array/Solution.py) 

#### Somehow nums.extend(nums) doesn't seem to work 

[Number of Good Pairs](./Number%20of%20Good%20Pairs/Solution.py)

#### Trick here is to use add the count each time we find a similar item since we are calculating the number of pairs, instead of storing in a map and then computing all the combinations.

[Count Pairs whose sum is less than target](./Count%20Pairs%20Whose%20Sum%20is%20Less%20than%20Target/Solution.py)

### Sorting can bring two pointer into play and reduce the complexity from n^2. Also check palces to avoid recomputation by handling logically.

[How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number](./How%20Many%20Numbers%20Are%20Smaller%20Than%20the%20Current%20Number/Solution.py)

### Balancing between storage and compute. Also noticed, enumerate changes the physically stored array but if looping without that and using sorted() we get sorted array just for the loop.

[Merge Sorted Array](./Merge%20Sorted%20Array/Solution.py)
### Look for reverse Engineering options
